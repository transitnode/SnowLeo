# SnowLeo

A self-hosted OSINT platform for collecting, analyzing, and organizing publicly available intelligence.

## Features (Planned)

### Core Intelligence Modules
- Domain Intelligence
 -WHOIS lookup (registrar, creation/expiry, name servers)
 -Domain history tracking
 -Registrar abuse/contact metadata
- DNS Analysis
 -A / AAAA / MX / TXT record resolution
 -Passive DNS enrichment
 -GeoIP mapping of resolved IPs
 -CDN detection (e.g. Cloudflare, Akamai)
- Website Analysis
 -HTTP header inspection
 -Security misconfiguration detection
 -Technology fingerprinting (CMS/framework detection)
 -Headless screenshot capture
- Certificate Transparency Monitoring
 -CT log querying
 -Subdomain extraction from certificates
 -Expired/renewed certificate tracking
 -Certificate chain analysis

### Discovery & Enrichment
- Subdomain Discovery
 -Passive CT-based enumeration
 -Optional DNS-based discovery
 -Aggregated domain surface mapping
- OSINT Enrichment Engine
 -Automatic expansion of input entities (domain/IP/email)
 -Cross-linking between datasets (DNS ↔ WHOIS ↔ certificates)
 -Confidence-based relationship mapping
- Footprint Analyzer
 -Relationship graph generation between entities
 -IP ↔ domain ↔ organization linking
 -Investigation timeline tracking
 -Graph-based visualization (future)

### Media & Metadata Analysis
- Reverse Image Search
 -Multi-source lookup (search engine integrations)
 -Image matching across public indexes
 -Metadata correlation (when available)
- EXIF Metadata Extractor
 -Camera/device metadata extraction
 -GPS coordinate parsing (if present)
 -Timestamp validation and inconsistencies
- Media Intelligence (Future)
 -Optional face clustering on user-provided datasets
 -Strictly non-identifying grouping of similar images
 -No person identification or scraping of individuals

### Reporting & Workflow
- Search History
 -Query tracking per session
 -Investigation timeline view
 -Session-based grouping
- Report Exporting
 -Markdown reports (initial)
 -JSON export for API usage
 -PDF report generation (future)
 -Structured “case file” output
- Investigation Workspaces (Future)
 -Multi-query projects
 -Saved entities and findings
 -Timeline and graph-based investigation view

### Security & Access (Planned)
- Authentication system (API keys / user accounts)
- Rate limiting per user
- Request logging and usage tracking

### Advanced Intelligence (Future)
- Passive OSINT data collection layer
- Historical dataset tracking (DNS/WHOIS changes over time)
- Intelligence graph database backend
- Automated enrichment pipelines
- Optional AI-generated summaries of findings

## Tech Stack

### Frontend: React
- Dashboard for queries, results, and investigation workflows

### Backend: Go
- Core API, routing, and high-performance OSINT queries

### Data Processing / Automation: Python
- Enrichment scripts, parsing, and external data integrations

### Database: MariaDB
- Stores structured intelligence data and relationships

### Optional Extensions: Node.js / Go / Python workers
- Real-time updates, background jobs, and specialized modules
